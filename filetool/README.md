## Note
You need to download AMR applications from the address: http://davis.lbl.gov/Manuals/BISICLES-DOCS/index.html.

BISICLES includes some tools used to perform miscellaneous actions on BISICLES/Chombo hdf5 files (amr files). They are located in the $BISICLES/code/filetools directory.

## Steps
Firstly, you need to copy the files in AMR/filetool/ to the directory of $BISICLES/code/filetool/, and compile.

After that, you can use filetool to extract data points and boxes, which are stored in some binary files of the form "datapoint_X".
